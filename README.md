# S3fileupload
Script for uploading files from desktop directly to S3.

This script enables you to directly upload files to S3 by drag and drop. 
The .py and .bat files need to be in the same folder in order to work. 
Just drag and drop the file you want to upload, directly on the batch file.

Sadly this script only works for uploading one file at a time, will see if that can be fixed.
